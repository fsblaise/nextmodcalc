# NextModCalc
This project is a simple calculator app, that helps Minecraft players designing different modded contraptions. It also calculates the resource costs and in the future it will render the built contraption using Three.js.
There is also authentication in the website, registered users can set a nickname and custom profile picture.

In the future they will be able to save different configurations, to use them later and there will be an import/export functionality using JSON files. 

## Technical details
The project is being developed in Next.js which uses the React library as it's base. <br>
For database, authentication and deployment, it uses Google Firebase. <br>
The UI Design is created with TailwindCSS and NextUI, which is also based on TailwindCSS. <br>

In the future, I will add React Three Fiber, which is a package for React application that is based on Three.js. 
It will be the major contributor to rendering the contraptions in 3D.
